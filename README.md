# Portfolio

This was my second project.
Here i used viewport and it is a simple one page portfolio featuring responsive design and 
i wrote css code inside style tag to make website look prettier.
i used many things like padding,font-size,max-width,box-shadow in style tag .
i wrote html code inside body tag and also used div tags.
